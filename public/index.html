    <h2>The Struggle</h2>
    <p>Joe is learning how to program in Philadelphia, however many people do not know that he is hungry. He spends his lunches fighting for scraps but still continues to program while his stomach rumbles. 
</p>
    <h2>Why to donate?</h2>
     <p><ul>
    <li>As many people know, without food we can die. Joe is an innocent developer who is doesn't want such a fate. Helping to feed Joe means that he can continue to develop programs to help people. When you help feed Joe, you help feed the world.
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>How to donate</h2>
    <p>Come to 1601 St Philadelphia PA to the NYCDA and ask the tired guy Joe about his fund.</p>
